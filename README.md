# Dr. Patterns Laboratory
![Unity: 2020.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/unity-2020.3-yellow)

This project was created during the work on a bachelor-thesis.
It is a prototype for an educational game about software design pattern.

## Questions
The following questions were asked after testers played the game:
1. "Regardless of the prototype: As a student of computer science, would you consider playing an educational game about software design patterns?"
2. "Can you imagine a complete game of this kind, for students, in terms of a course on software design patterns?"
3. "What did you think of the aesthetics and usability?"
4. "Did you learn something new with the help of the game?"
5. "What did you like least about the game and what did you miss most?"
6. "What did you like best about the game?"
